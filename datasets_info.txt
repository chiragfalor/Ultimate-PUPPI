train and test: normal processed datasets, rearranged vertices
train2 and test2: original processed datasets, not rearranged vertices
train3 and test3: unprocessed datasets with rearranged vertices
train4 and test4: unprocessed datasets with rearranged vertices and primary vertex removed
train5 and test5: processed datasets with rearranged vertices and primary vertex removed
train6 and test6: pruned versions of train7 and test7 with possibly better predictions for neutral particles
train7 and test7: same as train5 and test5 but with more data
train9 and test9: processed datasets with rearranged vertices and primary vertex removed with more features
all_data: rearranged vertices and primary vertex removed for all data
all_data2: processed all data with vtx0_pt > 150
all_data3: processed all data with vtx0_pt > 120
all_data4: processed all data with vtx0_pt > 100 and vtx_sum_pt < 300
all_data5: processed all data with vtx_sum_pt > 450
all_data6: processed all data with vtx0_pt < 40
